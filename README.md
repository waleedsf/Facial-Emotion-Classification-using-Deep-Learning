# Facial-Emotion-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

This project is a facial expression classification model that is trained to recognize different facial expressions in images. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and is trained on the [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadityasinghal/facial-expression-dataset) which contains over 27,000 images of faces with 7 different expressions: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprised. The pre-trained model is included in this repository, so you don't have to train your own model.

The model can be used to classify facial expressions in new images, by providing an image as input and it will output the predicted expression.

## Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### Note
All dependencies listed in requirements.txt are the default dependencies in google coolab notebooks, so it's Preferably to open the notebook in google colab, as it won't need to install them.
